{"name":"Detex","tagline":"A Python package for subspace detection and waveform similarity clustering","body":"# Detex\r\nDetex is a python program that performs subspace detection and waveform correlation detection for seismic data sets. I developed the code to perform research for my MS degree but several others have also used it.\r\nDetex relies heavily on [Obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)\r\nand [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).\r\n\r\nDetex, has not been extensively tested. If you would like to help test/develop detex you are welcome. \r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nTo install detex, first make sure that you have a working distribution of python 2.7. I recommend the [Anaconda distribution] (http://continuum.io/downloads).\r\nNext, clone (or download) Detex and run the setupy.py by typing into the terminal (or command line if using windows)\r\n``` bash\r\nPython setup.py install\r\n```\r\nThe install script will make sure you have the required packages and install detex in the appropriate place. \r\nNote: If the process fails to install basemap, which it has been known to do, you can find manual installation instructions [here]( http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html). Most of detex functionality does not require basemap so if you canâ€™t get it working you can still use the majority of detex. \r\n\r\n# Tutorial\r\nA tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/d-chambers/Detex/tree/master/Tutorial) which includes a docx file to which will walk you through the detex workflow and all the required files. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
