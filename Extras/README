These are scripts and old parts of detex that some people might find useful. I don't maintain them and some of them are a bit ugly so poke around at your own risk. 

ANF.py - Code to read Array Network Facilities (ANF) catalogs

arc.py - Simple parser for hypoinverse arc files

tearDown.py - A script for bumping version and cleaning up tests and tutorials. No longer needed because gitignore is used now

xcorr.py - old module of detex that did cross correlation. Its functionality has since been incorporated into the subspace module of detex.
