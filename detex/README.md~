# Detex
Detex is a python program that performs subspace detection and waveform correlation detection for seismic data sets. I developed the code to perform research for my MS degree but several others have also used it.

Detex relies heavily on [Obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)

and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

Detex, although it has worked well for me, has not been extensively tested on multiple data sets. If you would like to help test/develop detex your are welcome.
