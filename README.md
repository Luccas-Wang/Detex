# Detex
Detex is a python program that performs subspace detection and waveform correlation detection for seismic data sets. I developed the code to perform research for my MS degree but several others have also used it.

Detex relies heavily on [Obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)

and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

Detex, has not been extensively tested. If you would like to help test/develop detex you are welcome. 

A tutorial can be found [here](http://d-chambers.github.io/Detex/), all of the required files are found in the tutorial directory.
